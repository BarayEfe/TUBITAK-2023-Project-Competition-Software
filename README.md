# TUBITAK-2023-Project-Competition-Software
 A program to calculate how much time a student spends on each question in tests using AI.


The program tracks students' hands and the paper they are taking their exam on. Using this information it morphs the paper into the dimensions of an A4 paper. After this it will morph the location of the tip of the index finger of the student to this new A4 paper image. Using the details given in the `data.json` file, it will now increase the variable that indicates the time spent on the question the student has the tip of his/her index finger on.

The project was written to participate in 2023 TUBITAK Project competitions, taking place in Turkey, from the software category. It got 1st place in the regionals and 4th place in the nationals.
