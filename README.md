# TUBITAK-2023-Project-Competition-Software
 A program to calculate how much time a student spends on each question in tests using AI.


The program monitors the positioning of students’ hands and their exam papers during tests. It then adjusts the dimensions of the observed paper to match those of a standard A4 sheet. Subsequently, the software transforms the position of the student’s index finger tip to align with this newly formatted A4 paper image. Utilizing the data provided in the `data.json` file, the program then updates a variable to reflect the amount of time the student spends on the question that is currently worked on, indicated by the tip of their index finger.


The project, designed for the 2023 TUBITAK Project Competition in Turkey within the software category, achieved first place at the regional level and fourth place nationally.
