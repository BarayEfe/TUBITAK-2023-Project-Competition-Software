# TUBITAK-2023-Project-Competition-Software
 A program to calculate how much time a student spends on each question in tests using AI.


The program tracks students' hands and the paper they are taking their exam on. Using this information it morphs the paper into the dimensions of an A4 paper. After this it will morph the location of the tip of the index finger of the student to this new A4 paper image. Using the details given in the `data.json` file, it will now increase the variable that indicates the time spent on the question the student has the tip of his/her index finger on.

The project, designed for the 2023 TUBITAK Project Competition in Turkey within the software category, achieved first place at the regional level and fourth place nationally.
